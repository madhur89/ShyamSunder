            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Delhi is considered as one of the highly air polluted cities in the world. To improve the air quality of Delhi, way back in 1987 by a central law, Delhi has been declared as an air polluting zone. The main reason for air pollution in Delhi is its unplanned and haphazard growth which leads to the establishment of air polluting industrial units in both planned and unplanned manners, releasing different pollutants into the atmosphere. This study focuses on how to apply a dispersion model in urban areas where model input data and data from air quality monitoring stations are limited. Extensive 8-hourly passive ambient air monitoring at three established stations for 72 hours in both winter and summer seasons of 2019 were conducted using Fine Particulate Sampler and Respirable Dust Sampler. The results show that the distributions of PM10 & PM2.5 are quite high compared to the prescribed standard limits, suggesting the necessity to use short/long-term models to determine pollution potential and dispersion of particulate matter using air quality dispersion models.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Air pollution has emerged as a major environmental issue in urban areas. Delhi, being one of the most populated cities in the world, faces significant challenges related to air quality. The cityâ€™s unplanned growth has led to the establishment of numerous industrial units, both planned and unplanned, which release various pollutants into the atmosphere. This research aims to address the issue by applying a dispersion model in an urban area where both model input data and data from air quality monitoring stations are limited.</p>

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>The study involved extensive 8-hourly passive ambient air monitoring at three established stations for 72 hours during both winter and summer seasons of 2019. Fine Particulate Sampler and Respirable Dust Sampler were used to collect data on PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations. The data collected was then used to model the dispersion of particulate matter using air quality dispersion models.</p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>The analysis revealed that the concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 were significantly higher than the prescribed standard limits. This indicates a high level of air pollution in the monitored areas and underscores the need for effective air quality management and control measures.</p>

            <h2>Discussion</h2>
            <p>The findings of this study suggest that the current levels of PM10 and PM2.5 in Delhi are alarming and pose a serious threat to public health. The use of dispersion models can help in understanding the spread and concentration of these pollutants, thereby aiding in the formulation of effective policies and strategies to combat air pollution.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, this study highlights the severe air pollution levels in Delhi, primarily due to unplanned industrial growth and other factors. The application of air quality dispersion models is essential for predicting pollution levels and understanding the distribution of particulate matter. Effective air quality management strategies are crucial for improving the air quality in urban areas and protecting public health.</p>
